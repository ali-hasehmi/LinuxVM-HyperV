# What is Hyper-V

[Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-technology-overview) is a native [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) developed by Microsoft that allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on Windows. As a **Type 1 (bare-metal)** hypervisor, it runs directly on the host's hardware, providing **near-native performance** by efficiently managing system resources. Hyper-V is integrated into Windows, eliminating the need for additional software installations, and supports a wide range of operating systems, including various versions of *Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD*.  
Hyper-V offers advanced features such as live migration, which allows you to move running VMs between hosts without downtime, and dynamic memory allocation, which optimizes memory usage by adjusting the allocated memory to VMs as needed. It also provides robust security with features like shielded VMs to protect against unauthorized access, and nested virtualization, enabling the use of virtual machines within VMs. Hyper-V is ideal for both enterprise environments and development tasks, supporting scenarios from simple desktop virtualization to complex cloud and data center deployments.

# Why Bother to Write a Repository About Linux in Hyper-V?
Writing a repository about running Linux in Hyper-V might seem like an unusual or even unnecessary endeavor at first glance, but:  
1. One of the most significant reasons for creating a comprehensive repository is Microsoft's decision to end support for the Linux Integration Services (LIS) package for Hyper-V. This shift is largely due to Microsoft's strategic focus on promoting the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so we need a little of adaptation.

2. Another significant challenge is the scarcity of current and relevant materials available online. While some resources exist, many are outdated, incomplete, or scattered across various forums and websites. For users who want to get the most out of Hyper-V with Linux, finding reliable information can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. 

3. Despite the challenges, Hyper-V remains a powerful and viable option for running Linux VMs, especially for those who already have access to Windows. Hyper-V is a robust virtualization platform, offering high performance, advanced features, and deep integration with Windows environmentsâ€”all at no additional cost if you have an active Windows license.
