# What is Hyper-V

[Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-technology-overview) is a virtualization platform developed by Microsoft. It allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host machine. With Hyper-V, you can run multiple operating systems on a single physical server, each with its own dedicated resources and isolated from the others.

## What sets Hyper-V apart from other virtualization options on Windows?

Well, Hyper-V is already built into Windows, so you need no other software to make it work. But more importantly, it's a Type 1 [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), also known as a bare-metal hypervisor. This means you can run VMs directly on your hardware, which results **in near-native performance.**
